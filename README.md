# Geocoding Street Addresses using the ArcGIS API for Python

## Installation
Before using this code, the arcgis package must be installed.  For installation instructions see the 
ArcGIS documentation (https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/).

## Geocoding
This code uses argparse to take an input and output in the command line.  The input must be a csv and must have the full formatted street address in a field titled 'searchText'.  The 
output will give the according latitude and longitude.
